Overview
The project uses historical soccer match data to perform the following:

Feature Engineering: Derive meaningful features such as team form, goals scored, and match outcomes.
Machine Learning: Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict match outcomes.
Clustering: Use K-Means and PCA to group teams based on performance metrics.
Team Ranking: Apply the PageRank algorithm to rank teams based on match results.
Community Detection: Detect communities of teams using network analysis.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Encoding team names and deriving team performance metrics.
Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between performance-related features.
Outcome Prediction:
Train a Random Forest Classifier.
Tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.
Clustering:
Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Use K-Means to cluster teams based on performance.
Team Rankings:
Build a directed graph from match outcomes.
Compute PageRank scores to rank teams.
Community Detection:
Use modularity-based community detection to group teams.
Analyze community-level performance.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy: Data handling and preprocessing.
matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization.
